This article describes how to add the app security feature introduced by TapTap to your game.

## Description of APK hardening function

### Functional features

| Function Name | Descriptions | 
| --- | --- |
| SO Encryption Protection | Encrypt and obfuscate the code, function and export table of the SO file to prevent HOOK attacks and effectively improve the difficulty of shelling. |
| global-metadata Encrypted |For IL2CPP games, the global-metadata is hardened to raise the cracking threshold. |
| AAB Reinforcement | Support for Android app bundle hardening solutions. |
| Reinforcement programme self-protection | Obfuscating the source code of the augmentation scheme greatly raises the threshold of the plug-in author's reverse analysis of the augmentation scheme, further increasing the difficulty of cracking the game. |
| ROOT Environmental Testing | Reduce the potential for fraud in high-risk environments. |
| Debugging Against | Detection of debugging tools such as IDA, FRIDA, etc., effectively raising the threshold for dynamic analysis. |
| Simulator Recognition | Based on a sample library, it accurately identifies simulator users and provides an accurate basis for game segregation matching. |
| Cloud Mobile Phone Recognition | Multi-dimensional determination of the cloud phone environment based on real phone data and multiple cloud phone samples from the extranet. |
| Anti Secondary Packaging | To keep the signature consistent before and after reinforcement, you can enable signature verification to prevent secondary packaging. |
| Malware Countermeasure | Anti-frame plug-ins, memory modifiers, multi-openers and other software. |

### Operating Instructions

#### Function Entrance

- For games that have not joined the Payroll programme and have exclusive hairstyles on TapTap, you can access them directly through the **Application Security** portal, or contact the relevant business or operations department to apply for the programme if there is no such portal.

- For games on the Payroll programme, you can select the APK enhancement rights directly from the Payroll page and click Use Now (as shown below).

#### Rules

- The number of successful reinforcement attempts per game per natural month is limited to 5, so developers should not abuse the service;
- For users with multi-channel requirements, please ensure that the project is in normal operation if reinforcement is required before secondary packaging. The size of the backup file should not exceed 2G;
- The size of the augmentation file should not exceed 2G;
- Reinforcement does not support automatic signing and you must re-sign after reinforcement;
- You can only reinforce a maximum of 2 files each time.

## Description of the anti-cheating function

The anti-cheat detection function is mainly used to display the data of illegal operation and the environment of the platform that monitors and captures the application when it is running after the game has passed the reinforcement. By displaying cheating devices and related details, developers can gain a deep understanding of the current security situation and accurately grasp the security posture.
